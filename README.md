A prototype of what will one day be a mail-delivery open-world meditative game where you play as a bird carrying supplies between the avian inhabitants of an Earth post-humanity.

This was a side project that I will return to at a later date. The prototype was created in Godot to test how the engine handles 3D objects and physics.
